```

are due to upstream issues in Julia. The issue is a race condition that we experience when running multiple processes. For more information, please see the issue ([#31953](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31953)).

The source of the race conditions can happen in multiple ways. And the issue is more common when using the `JULIA_DEPOT_PATH`, which is specified in our `.buildkite/pipeline.yml` files.

We "accept" using this flakey test configuration because it speeds up initialization from ~10-15 min per build to ~1 min per build. We could abandon using the Julia depot path, but then our continuous integration test times, and the time until the tests start, will take 10-15 min longer. So using the Julia depot path has upsides and downsides.

Sometimes this race condition can lead to a corrupted depot path, in which case we need to clear (delete) the depot path on Caltech Central in order to un-break CI. These issues are per-repo, and we have a few buildkite pipelines dedicated to making this easy (for those repos using the Julia depot path).

If you want to opt-out of using the Julia depot path, then simply delete the environment variable in the buildkite yaml file, which looks like this:

```
  JULIA_DEPOT_PATH: "${BUILDKITE_BUILD_PATH}/${BUILDKITE_PIPELINE_SLUG}/depot/cpu"
```

## üö® Error: The command exited with status 137

This error is indicative of insufficient memory for a job. One way to fix this is to request more memory for the job:

```
      - label: "held suarez (œÅŒ∏)"
        command: "julia --project=examples examples/driver.jl"
        artifact_paths: "held_suarez/*"
        agents:           # need to add this
          slurm_mem: 20GB # need to add this (with appropriate memory request)
```

## ERROR: LoadError: importing ___ into Main conflicts with an existing identifier

Older versions of julia did not support importing packages with the syntax

```julia
import OrdinaryDiffEq as ODE
```

One way around this was to define a constant

```julia
import OrdinaryDiffEq
const ODE = OrdinaryDiffEq
```

However, these two ways of importing are in conflict with one another, and trying them both together, in the same scope, results in the error `ERROR: LoadError: importing ODE into Main conflicts with an existing identifier`.
